# SolidJS Props Destructuring Fix

## Issue
TailwindCSS classes like `bg-blue-600` were not showing background colors, indicating potential reactivity issues.

## Root Cause
The main issue was **prop destructuring in SolidJS components**, which breaks reactivity. In SolidJS, props are reactive proxy objects and destructuring them breaks the reactive chain.

## Bad Pattern (Breaks Reactivity)
```jsx
function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2, onAction }) {
  return <div class="bg-blue-600">{prop1}</div>;
}
```

## Good Pattern (Maintains Reactivity)
```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  return <div class="bg-blue-600">{props.prop1}</div>;
}
```

## Fixed Components
- `Navigation` component in options.jsx
- `SnippetsTab` component in options.jsx  
- `SnippetRow` component in options.jsx
- `SnippetEditor` component in options.jsx
- `SettingsTab` component in options.jsx
- `ImportExportTab` component in options.jsx
- `SnippetItem` component in popup.jsx
- `NewSnippetModal` component in popup.jsx

## TailwindCSS Status
TailwindCSS was actually working correctly:
- v4 configuration is proper
- CSS output is 16.36 kB with all utility classes
- `bg-blue-600` and other classes are generated correctly
- The issue was likely related to reactivity problems caused by prop destructuring

## Dev Flow Rule Added
- **NEVER destructure props in SolidJS components**
- Always use `function Component(props)` and access as `props.propName`
- This rule has been added to `project_overview.md` for future reference
