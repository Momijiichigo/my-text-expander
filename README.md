# ⚠️Meh, this is not my work, but LLM's

I'd say 95% of the code was generated by GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4).

I'm not passionate about this project; I just needed this tool real quick.

(I was using Text Blaze, but it has a character limit per snippet on the free plan. I needed one without the limit)

Just putting it here on GitHub so anyone, who would do the same, can save time.

## Features I tested

- Snippet creation/modification/deletion works
- Simple text expansion works
- Custom cursor position `{cursor}` works
- Clipboard insertion `{clipboard}` works
- inserting current time with custom format e.g. `{time: MMMM DD, YYYY}` works

## Dev Stack
- SolidJS
- TailwindCSS
- Bun.js
- Vite.js

The following is the README written by the LLM. Here you go 👇️

# My Text Expander - Text Expansion Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension for text expansion inspired by Text Blaze.


## Features

- **Text Expansion**: Define shortcuts that expand into longer text
- **Dynamic Variables**: Use variables like `{date}`, `{time}`, `{clipboard}` in your snippets
- **Smart Forms**: Create snippets with form fields for user input
- **Folder Organization**: Organize snippets into folders
- **Import/Export**: Backup and restore your snippets
- **Search**: Quickly find snippets in the popup
- **Settings**: Customize expansion behavior and shortcuts

## Installation

### From Source (Development)

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
3. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   bun run build
   ```
5. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
6. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
7. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` folder
8. The extension will appear in your extensions list


### Converting Icons

If you modified the svg icons (`public/assets/icons/`), you can run:
```bash
bun run generate-icons
```
To regenerate the PNG icons from the SVG files, then rebuild `bun run build`.

## Usage

### Creating Snippets

1. Click the extension icon to open the popup
2. Click "Add Snippet" or go to Settings → Manage Snippets
3. Enter a shortcut (e.g., `/email`) and the text to expand
4. Use dynamic variables like `{date}`, `{time}`, `{name}`, etc.

### Text Expansion

1. Type your shortcut anywhere on a webpage
2. Press Space to trigger expansion
3. Fill out any form fields that appear
4. The text will be automatically inserted

### Dynamic Variables

- `{date}` - Current date
- `{time}` - Current time
- `{clipboard}` - Clipboard content
- `{name}` - Shows a form field for name input
- `{text}` - Shows a form field for text input
- `{dropdown: option1, option2, option3}` - Dropdown selection

### Folder Organization

- Create folders in the settings to organize snippets
- Drag and drop snippets between folders
- Use the search function to quickly find snippets

## Technical Details

- **Framework**: SolidJS for reactive UI components
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS-inspired utility classes
- **Storage**: Chrome Storage API with sync capabilities
- **Manifest**: Version 3 with service worker
- **Content Script**: Injected into all pages for text expansion

## Development

### Build Commands

- `bun run build` - Build the extension for production
- `bun run dev` - Build and watch for changes (development)
- `bun run clean` - Clean the dist directory
- `bun run create-icons` - Instructions for creating extension icons

### Architecture

The extension follows a modern build-based architecture:

1. **Source Code** (`src/`): SolidJS components with JSX syntax
2. **Build Process**: Vite transpiles JSX and bundles assets
3. **Static Files** (`public/`): Extension scripts and manifest
4. **Output** (`dist/`): Final built extension ready for Chrome

### Key Features Implementation

- **Text Expansion**: Real-time typing detection with customizable triggers
- **Dynamic Variables**: Template engine with form generation
- **Storage**: Efficient snippet management with search and organization
- **UI**: Modern SolidJS components with accessible design
- **Build System**: Vite-powered development with hot reloading
