# UI Fixes and TailwindCSS Migration

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Delete Snippet Not Refreshing List ✅
**Problem**: After deleting a snippet, the list didn't update to reflect the change.

**Root Cause**: The `loadData()` function wasn't being called after successful deletion.

**Fix**: 
- Added explicit `await loadData()` call after successful deletion
- Added detailed logging to track the deletion process
- Ensured error handling doesn't interfere with refresh

### 2. Edit Button Showing "Create" Instead of "Edit" ✅
**Problem**: When clicking "Edit" on existing snippets, the modal showed "Create New Snippet" instead of "Edit Snippet".

**Root Cause**: The condition was checking `snippet.id` instead of `snippet.shortcut` to determine if editing existing vs creating new.

**Fix**:
- Changed condition from `snippet.id ? 'Edit' : 'Create'` to `snippet.shortcut ? 'Edit' : 'Create'`
- This properly detects existing snippets that have shortcut values

### 3. TailwindCSS Migration ✅
**Problem**: Extension was using custom CSS files instead of TailwindCSS utility classes.

**Changes Made**:
- **Installed TailwindCSS dependencies**: `@tailwindcss/postcss`, `autoprefixer`
- **Created configuration files**: `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`
- **Replaced CSS files** with TailwindCSS imports (`@tailwind base/components/utilities`)
- **Converted all components** to use TailwindCSS utility classes

### Component Updates

## Testing Instructions

1. **Reload extension** in browser
2. **Open options page**
3. **Test Edit button**: Click edit on existing snippet - should show "Edit Snippet"
4. **Test Delete button**: Delete a snippet - list should refresh immediately
5. **Test Create button**: Click "New Snippet" - should show "Create New Snippet"
